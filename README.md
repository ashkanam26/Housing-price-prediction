# california housing price prediction

## project overview
this project focuses on predicting house prices in california using machine learning model.

## goal
to build a predictive model for estimating house prices based on features such as median income, average rooms, population, and more.

## dataset
the dataset used is the **california housing dataset** from `scikit-learn`.

## models and results
 we evaluated three models and selected the best one:
1. **linear regression**
2. **random forest regressor**
3. **xgboost regressor (selected model)**
